# [Project Rome](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/project-rome)

Project Rome is an initiative conceived to rethink Windows as a platform as we seek to deliver a more personal operating system for the next generation of computing. Its focus is on delivering APIs and features to drive deeper engagement by bridging silos between devices, apps, people, and cloud services â€“ democratizing our vision of mobility of experiences and people-centric, ubiquitous computing.

- A set of infrastructure services in the Microsoft cloud for Windows-based devices, as well as cross-platform and IoT.
- A programming model delivered as APIs for Windows, Android, iOS, and Microsoft Graph, enabling client and cloud apps to build experiences using the Project Rome capabilities.
A device runtime for connecting and integrating Windows-based, cross-platform, and IoT devices to the Project Rome infrastructure services.
