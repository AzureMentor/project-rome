# Project Rome for Microsoft Graph

Project Rome features can be implemented through REST API calls with [Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/docs/api-reference/beta/resources/project_rome_overview). This allows you to discover your windows devices, launch apps, and interact with app services from any device capable of making HTTP requests.
