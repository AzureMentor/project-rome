# Commanding

Commanding allows you to initiate actions remotely using a local device. 

Actions can include remote app launching, remote messaging, and the process of discovering and identifying remote systems to connect to. The actions taken by these target devices are covered in the [Hosting](../hosting/index.md) scenarios.

To get started with Commanding scenarios on your client device, select your preferred development platform on the left navigation pane.
