# Handle remote action requests on a local device with Hosting

The Hosting scenarios include cases in which a local app receives and handles action requests, such as app launch requests or app service messages, from apps on remote devices. Hosting is the necessary counterpart of the [Commanding](../commanding/index.md) scenarios.

To get started with Hosting scenarios on your client device, select your preferred development platform on the left navigation pane.
