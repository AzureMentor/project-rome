# Connect to other devices through a session using Remote Sessions

The Remote sessions feature allows an app to connect to other devices through a session, either for explicit app-to-app messaging or for brokered exchange of system-managed data. Sessions can be created by any device on a supported platform, and other devices, including devices signed in by other users, can request to join.
